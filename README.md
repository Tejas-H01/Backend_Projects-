# Backend Practice Lab

A backend practice repository built using Spring Boot, designed to strengthen backend fundamentals through incremental, real-world–style implementations.

This repository is maintained as a **backend engineering lab**, focusing on correctness, clarity, and disciplined learning rather than tutorials or quick demos.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Build strong backend fundamentals
- Learn backend technologies through implementation, not theory
- Practice real-world backend patterns incrementally
- Develop discipline in clean code and version control

This is **not** a tutorial or throwaway repository.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Phase-wise)

### Phase 1 — Core Backend (Current)
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- Maven

### Phase 2 — Advanced Backend Concepts (Planned)
- Exception handling and validation
- Authentication and basic security
- Pagination and filtering
- API design best practices

### Phase 3 — System Expansion (Planned)
- NoSQL fundamentals (MongoDB)
- Event-driven basics (Kafka)
- Asynchronous processing concepts

---

## 🌱 Repository Evolution Strategy

This repository evolves **without losing continuity**, reflecting how backend systems grow over time:

- `main` branch  
  → Core Spring Boot backend with relational database

- `nosql` branch  
  → NoSQL-based experiments and data modeling

- `events` branch  
  → Event-driven and asynchronous patterns

Each branch represents a deliberate learning milestone.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure database credentials in `application.properties`
3. Run the Spring Boot application
4. Test endpoints using Postman or browser

---

## 📌 Status

🚧 Under active development  
Features are added incrementally with meaningful, traceable commits.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Fundamentals before frameworks
- One concept at a time
- Clarity over cleverness
- Discipline over shortcuts
